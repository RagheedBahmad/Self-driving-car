# Self-driving-car
This is my first time practicing neural networks with JavaScript. I followed this video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI),
and took me a night and day to complete.

It needs some graphical polishing but that doesn't really matter.
This is the beginning of a long journey that I am excited to start with AI and Machine Learning.
