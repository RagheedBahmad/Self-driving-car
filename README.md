This is my first time practicing neural networks with JavaScript. 
I followed this video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI) and it took me a night and a day to complete. 

Learning how to hard-code a neural network was very fun and informative. And seeing your creation come to life is fulfilling. This project was one of my first endeavors to better my skills.
